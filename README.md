 These notes are created using a static site generator called [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/),and hosted, for free, on Google's cloud infrastructure, [FireBase](https://firebase.google.com/).  Both Firebase and Vue are tools that demonstrate some of the latest Web Technologies.

Hello! I am very excited to be working with you for, what will be, your last technical unit of the course. This unit promises to be interesting, you are going to be using everything you have learnt so far to create a modern single-page web application that addresses a problem that has been defined by an industry partner - [Dootrix](https://dootrix.com/work/pando/).

The application will assist students in their university experience. You will use appropriate requirements gathering and development methodologies to deliver this application. You will need to demonstrate this has been done over two assessments:

### Assessment Summaries


Below is a quick summary of each assessment. You should, however, ensure you read the assessment briefs in full ([assessment 1 brief](./assessments/assessment_1.md) , [assessment 2 brief](./assessments/assessment_2.md)) 

#### 1) [Proposal and exploration -  2000 Words](./assessments/assessment_1.md)

The practical outcomes for this unit are to create a responsive single page web-application supporting students in their university experience. This idea has been proposed by our industry partners - Dootrix. They will be presenting their ideas in the first lecture of the term so it is vital you attend.

This assessment represents the exploratory phase of the wider project. Specifically, you are trying to find out in what ways students are underserved in their day-to-day university lives and how a web-application could help. Your findings, proposed solution and user feedback of the solution will form the basis of this current assessment. 

#### 2) [Delivery of application - 2000 Words + Application](./assessments/assessment_2.md)

This assessment represents the delivery phase of the project.  You can focus on two routes design and development (see below). Regardless of the route chosen, a single page JavaScript application tested with users will be delivered. Supporting this delivery will be 2000 words of documentation outlining the process.

## Practical Structure 

The practicals will focus on exploring how to create a modern web application using Google's React framework. By the end of the unit you should be able to practically address the following questions:

How can we create a modern scalable web applications?

- How can we deploy in to a scalable infrastructure?
- How can we set security levels based on user classes? 
- How can we persist data?
- How can we manage state in a web application? 

 
 ## Engaging with the course content
